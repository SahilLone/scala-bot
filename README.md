# ScalaBot

ScalaBot is a light-weight Scala Library that can be used to easily create ChatBots.

Among its features, it includes:
- custom replies for input
- chat history
- details about the person currently talking to
- session-based memory ( in progress )
- previous sessions memory (TBI)
- ability to recognize certain topics (TBI).

It was inspired by AIML
